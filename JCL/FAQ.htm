<H3><A name=Install>Question: How do I install the JEDI Code Library?</A></H3>
<P>
The JEDI Code Library doesn't have to be installed. You just unzip the sources
into a folder of your liking, add this folder to your library path and include
the desired units in your applications uses clause.<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Unzip the JCL.zip file into a folder of your liking.
  <LI>In Delphi select "Tools | Environment Options", turn to the "Library" tab
      and add the folder to the "Library Path".
</UL>
Note that the current JCL release does include design time packages for both
Delphi 4 and Delphi 5 which can be installed in Delphi. Generally this is not
necessary but if you use the JCL in components or perhaps an application build
with packages then you may prefer to do this. To install the package:
<UL>
  <LI>Select "File | Open", browse to the folder you unzipped the JCL to and select
      the DJCL50.dpk (Delphi 5) or DJCL40.dpk (Delphi 4) package.
  <LI>In the dialog that appears click the install button.
</UL>
The package will now be build and installed. Note that you will still have to
update the libary path in order to use the JCL units (see above).
<P>
<H3><A name=WheresTheHelp>Question: Where's the helpfile?</A></H3>
<P>
The helpfile is a separate download. You can find it on the same page from where
you downloaded the source code. Browse to <A HREF="http://delphi-jedi.org/CODELIBJCL">JCL Homepage</A>
go to the downloads page and select the "Download Helpfile" link. This will give
you a file named JCL-Help.zip. Unzip it into a folder of your liking and double-click
the JCL.chm file.
<P>
<H3><A name=WhatsAChm>Question: What's a .CHM and how do I open it?</A></H3>
<P>
A .chm is a Microsoft Compiled HTML help-file. It's the standard for new helpfiles
for Windows 98 and Windows 2000. A .chm is basically a replacement for the old
WinHelp style helpfiles and instead of being based on RTF it is based on HTML (and
as such you can do anything in the helpfile you can do with standard HTML).
To view a .chm file you will need to have HTML Help installed on your system.
HTML Help is installed by default by Windows 98 and Windows 2000 and most recent
Microsoft applications (IE5, Office 2000 etc) will install it if it's not there
already. If however you don't have HTML Help installed you can download it from
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/htmlhelp/default.asp">
Microsoft HTML Help homepage</a>. After installing you should be able to view
the JCL helpfile by double clicking it in explorer.<BR>
<P>
Tip: Add the helpfile to Delphi's Tools menu. To do so select the "Tools | Configure Tools"
menu item in the Delphi IDE, click the Add button and edit fill in the information in
the dialog as follows:<BR>
<DL>
<DD><I>Title</I> Whatever you like, for example "JCL Help". This will be the caption of the menu item.
<DD><I>Program</I> hh.exe
<DD><I>Working dir</I> [JCLFOLDER]
<DD><I>Parameters</I> "[JCLFOLDER]\JCL.chm"
</DL>
Where [JCLFOLDER] is the full path to the JCL helpfile.
<P>
<H3><A name=ContextSensitiveHelp>Question: What about context sensitive help?</A></H3>
<P>
Unfortunately it is not possible (yet) to press F1 on an identifier declared in
the JCL and go directly to the help topic for that identifier. This is not a
limitation of Compiled HTML Help but rather a consequence of Borland not supporting
HTML Help in the IDE yet. A Delphi expert to intercept context sensitive help
requests for the JCL is being worked on and will be made available when it's
ready. Keep an out for it on the downloads page.
<P>
<H3><A name=Delphi3>Question: What about support for Delphi 3?</A></H3>
<P>
Delphi 3 is not supported and there is very little chance that it ever will. The
JCL is developed for use, and tested with, Delphi 5 and that's the only version
we support. Nonetheless wherever possible we do try to support Delphi 4 and are
not aware of any problems when using the JCL with Delphi 4 - although it's recommended
that you do apply the latest Update Pack (downloadable from the Borland website).
<P>
<H3><A name=CPPBuilder>Question: What about support for C++ Builder?</A></H3>
<P>
C++ Builder is not supported and there is very little chance that it ever will. The
JCL is developed for use, and tested with, Delphi 5 and that's the only version
we support. Nonetheless wherever possible we do try to support C++ Builder and are
not aware of any problems when using the JCL with C++ Builder 4 or 5.
<P>
<H3><A name=FPC>Question: What about support for FPC?</A></H3>
<P>
Currently FPC is not fully supported. However, one of our goals is to provide
full support for FPC in the near future. Marco van de Voort from the FPC group
is working on this.
