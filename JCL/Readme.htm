<H3>Supported Compilers</H3>
<P>
The JCL is build using and tested with the current version of Delphi only. At the
moment of writing this is Delphi 5. The JCL is not supported on or tested with any
other version of Delphi or C++ Builder. As a result, it is very unlikely that
the JCL will be usable or even compile with earlier version of Delphi and C++ Builder.
The possible exceptions being Delphi 4, C++ Builder 4 and 5 - but that would be
sheer luck. The JCL will not compile with Delphi 3, C++ Builder 3 or earlier
versions. The reason for this is quite simple, we have no time to support them! All
the members of the JCL team are volunteers and our time is limited. The work involved
with implementing, for example Delphi 3, support and manage the complexities
introduced by it, imo, cannot be justified.

<P>We realize that this decision potentially prevents a large group of developers
from using the JCL in their projects and we are truly sorry about that. If you
have some (a lot of!) spare time and are willing to help implement support for
earlier versions please <A HREF="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org">contact us</A>.
