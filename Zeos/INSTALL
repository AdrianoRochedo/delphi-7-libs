INSTALLATION OF ZEOSDBO
=======================

You can download the current version from http://www.zeoslib.net (section Downloads).

1. Unpack the archive to a folder

2. Copy the required dlls from lib directory to the windows system directory 
(usually Windows\System or winnt\system32).

3. Locate the package directory associated with your compiler and open the ZeosDbo.bpg 
project group.  Load the project and install the following components in the order
listed:
	- ZCore.bpl
	- ZParse.bpl
	- ZParseSql.bpl
	- ZPlain.bpl
	- ZDbc.bpl
	- ZComponent.bpl

4. Create your own project and start adding the compoents through the IDE and set 
connection properties.  For a quick tutorial, use the example provided with the
project or browse the resources on the web page.

LIMITATIONS:

1. While installing ZeosDBO under C++ Builder version 4 from the IDE, you may get this
error when compiling the ZDbc package :

<<
[Pascal Fatal Error] ZDbcMetadata.pas(3076): Internal error: SY876.
>>

Currently, there is no known solution to this problem.  Therefore, it is recommended 
to compile Zeoslib from the command line (issuing a 'make -f ZeosDBO.bpg' from the
directory '\packages\cbuilder4' should accomplish this) and then to install the
packages through menu Component->Install Packages.
