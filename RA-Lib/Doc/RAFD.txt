Overview
--------

R&A Form Designer (RAFD) is run-time form designer for Delphi
programs. It can open, create, modifing, save native Delphi
forms stored in dfm/pas files. Full source code included.
This RAFD is compatible with Borland Delphi 3, 4, 5.

R&A Form Designer is part of R&A Library which is a freeware product.

1. Designer.
This is designer for Delphi native form files and units.
It can be used only as package.
Designer contains the following parts:
  - designer for manipulating with forms;
  - text editor for manipulating with unit sources;
  - project manager (very simple and not complete);
  - main window - AppBuilder for open, saving files,...;
  - component pallete and run-time package loading support
    for loading new packages without recompiling Form Designer;
  - implementation (not all) of Delphi ToolsAPI to make it possible
    to load native Delphi experts into Form Designer environment.    

2. Design Packages.
Due conflict with Borland Deploy licence we (and you) can't
distribute Delphi design packages with our applications.
This packages work fine in RAFD, but...
So we start to wrote our one design packages for standard Delphi
components. Those packages placed in RALIB\DPACKS folder.
Those packages register standard Delphi components and contains
some property and component editors. The most harded editors
allready writen. This are Menu Builder, Dataset Designer,
Collection Editor, TStrings Property Editor and others.
Not all Delphi editors implemented, so we need your help on this way!
Contact with as!

3. RAd October demo project.
This demo project can be found in RALIB\DEMOS\RADOCTOBER\RAdOctober30.dpr
(RAdOctober40.dpr for Delphi 4, RAdOctober50.dpr for Delphi 4) file. 
It used by us to tests R&A Form Designer. This very simple 
project conatains only splash and create in run-time instance 
of TRAAppBuilder component and run it.

4. Demo forms.

5. There are no help files for R&A Form Designer now. Sorry.
