      TeeChart Designer
===========================================================

The TeeChart Designer is an stand-alone application 
intended to be used to create, save and reload Chart files.

It uses a standard Delphi TStringGrid component to interface
with the Chart Series point values.

In this version, the Chart Designer uses only the non-database
Chart components.

The next coming version will implement database Charts, allowing
connecting Series to any Table or Query using the Borland Database
Engine.

The *.TEE files generated by the Chart Designer can be used 
in several ways, in your applications, ActiveX Forms, etc.

Please see "Saving and Loading Charts" folder for complete
technical details about the *.TEE files.
