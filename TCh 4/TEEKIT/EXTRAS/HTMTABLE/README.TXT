WARNING: This demo runs in 32-bit only.

-----------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

In Delphi 2 and C++ Builder, please install
the TEEHTM.PAS unit before running this demo.

In Delphi 3, this unit is already installed 
in TeeChart-Pro packages.


This unit (TEEHTM.PAS) installs a new component:

TImporter

This non-visible component process an HTM file by
selecting HTML Table cells and adding the table
cell contents into a standard TChart component.

Not all HTML Tables can be decoded properly due to
the highly customizable options in HTML language.

Included you'll find several HTML files containing
tables which can be imported into a TeeChart component.
